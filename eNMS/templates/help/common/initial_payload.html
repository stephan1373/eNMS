      The <b>Initial Payload</b> parameter provides starting data that can be referenced
      later by service(s). This parameter is a dictionary with key/value pairs. This
      parameter is always present and will default to "<b>{ }</b>".
    </p>
    <p>
      Important note: only one <b>Initial Payload</b> matters during a run: the one
      populated for the service or workflow being run. If the user runs a workflow, the
      <b>Initial Payload</b> defined on the workflow will be used (and any service
      <b>Initial Payload</b> is ignored). If the user runs an individual service, that
      service's <b>Initial Payload</b> will be used if defined (and the workflow
      <b>Initial Payload</b> is ignored if defined).
